It is either essential for some reason or helps make the response even faster by reacting the very moment that property is set.",

Checking that the properties are loaded is needed due to this change: https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/vendor_calyx/+/16713\n\nIt\u0027s to make sure that the persist property has been loaded, if it was set; without this, it will react to it being default 0 in userdebug even if it was changed by the user to something else.",
